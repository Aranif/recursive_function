<h1>Description</h1>

<p>This program will help you understand how resursive works in C. If you have never programmed in C and you are new, the code may be a little confusing. </p>
<p>concept: A recursive function is still a function that calls itself. It runs until some condition is met that allows it to stop running. <bold>IMPORTANT</bold> There must be a condition or something that when met stops calling itself, otherwise it will make an infinite loop.
